Co-founder @marqo.ai. [Building the next generation of search](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo).

Prior to Marqo, I was a machine learning (ML) lead working at Amazon Robotics AI (RAI) within the ML and computer vision team. I designed and led the implementation of [Janus](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/amazon-robotics-continual-learning-reinforcement-learning-janus-framework) a [continual learning](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/robin-deals-with-a-world-where-things-are-changing-all-around-it) framework. I also led the development of the deep learning models for the perception system of Amazon's [Robin robot](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/robin-deals-with-a-world-where-things-are-changing-all-around-it). Prior to RAI, I was leading the development of ML for new technologies, working at the intersection of the smart home and IoT.  Before Amazon, I worked at Stitch Fix doing a mix of data science, machine learning and operations research. Prior to industry, I was a physicist working to develop lensless imaging techniques by solving inverse problems using non-convex optimization methods.  I was the recipient of a [Volkswagen Foundation](https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/en/foundation) [Paul-Ewald Fellowship](https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/en/funding/free-electron-laser-science-peter-paul-ewald-fellowships-at-lcls-in-stanford) while working at Stanford and prior to that I was working at University College London. This research resulted in a number of significant achievements in nanoscale imaging and high impact publications in journals such as Science, Nature Physics, Nature Materials, Nature Communications, PNAS, and Physical Review Letters (see [Google scholar link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Eighd10AAAAJ&hl=en) to publications list).
