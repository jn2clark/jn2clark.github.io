I am a Senior Applied Scientist working at Amazon Robotics AI within the machine learning and computer vision team working on [Robin](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/amazon-robotics-see-robin-robot-arms-in-action).  Previously, I was a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Amazon (Alexa new technologies), working at the intersection of the smart home and IoT (researching, developing, and prototyping novel machine learning algorithms for new technologies).  Previously I was a physicist (Stanford, University College London) working to develop lensless imaging techniques by solving inverse problems using non-convex optimization methods.  This research resulted in a number of significant achievements in nanoscale imaging (see contact information for Google scholar link to publications list).
